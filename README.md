How the original game looks.

How my current version looks like. 

# How To Play
-Each level consists of a 5x5 board of cards. 

-Each card is either **x1**, **x2**, **x3**, or **BOOM!** Flipping any of the multiplier cards will increase your current level score by that much (if your score is 0, it will be increased to 1 before multiplying) while BOOM! will get you a game over and set your current level score to 0. 

-The level is cleared when the player reveals all x2/x3 cards on the board. The game can also automatically prematurely end if the player hits a BOOM! card instead.

-At the end every column and row is a set of two numbers which are value-bomb indicators. The **top number is the total value of the multiplier cards** in said row/column while the **bottom number is the number of bombs** in that row/column. Use this to your advantage to make educated guesses on which rows/columns are more dangerous than others to flip cards on.

* *For example, look at this board where all the cards are revealed. In the first row, left to right, if you add them up you will get 5 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) and 0 bombs. Indeed the value-bomb indicator at the end of the row (blue) reads 5 - 0. Similarly, if you look at the first column top to bottom, you'll see the values in that column add up to 6 (1 + 2 + 2 + 1) and there is one bomb in the column, adding up to 6 - 1 on the first column value-bomb indicator (also blue).* *

-Higher levels increase the number of x2/x3 cards on the board but also increase the number of bomb cards.

-When the player gets game over by hitting the bomb, they may be demoted to a lower level if the total number of x2 + x3 cards they revealed is less then the current level's number, in that case they will be demoted to the level number equal to how many x2 plus x3 cards they did reveal in that level before flipping a bomb. For example, say in level 3, I flip 4 x2 cards then hit a bomb, I will not be demoted since I flipped more x2/x3 cards than the current level's number. But if I am in level  and flip 2 x3 cards before hitting a bomb, 2 is less than level 7 so I will be demoted, and since I flipped only 2 x3's I will be demoted all the way back to level 2!

-Tip: Flipping a x1 card does nothing to increase your score or get you closer to clearing a level. If you deduce a card can only be either a x1 or bomb based on the column/row indicators, it's probably a good idea to not even bother flipping it!

- http://voltorbflip.com/ - A voltorb flip solver. While this was created for the original Voltorb Flip minigame in Pokemon HGSS, since my game is mechnically identical to the original, this should work for it. Note that while some levels can be "solved" with logic and deduction, the game still has a healthy amount of luck involved such that there will always be a point where the player has to flip card with uncertainity (for example a new board where all rows/columns have at least 1 bomb), thus the game cannot be solved by a computer every time and this solver's algorithm is not necessarily the optimal or safest way to play the game either.
